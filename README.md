# IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone
SpaceX is a aerospace manufacturer, space transportation services and communications corporation which is a disruptive just like Tesla both founded by Elon Musk.Despite being less than 20 years old SpaceX has managed to reduce the cost by more than 50% compared to other company and said to reduce by 99% when the Starship project will be completed.In this capstone we will be analyzing the data ,from wiki extracted through web scrapping and spacex api to get insights and predict booster landing to drone ship safely .

## Data collection methodology
Using SpaceX Rest API
Using Web Scrapping from Wikipedia

## Performed data wrangling
Filtering the data
Dealing with missing values
Using One Hot Encoding to prepare the data to a binary classification

## Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization and SQL
## Performed interactive visual analytics using Folium and Plotly Dash
## Performed predictive analysis using classification models
## Building, tuning and evaluation of classification models to ensure the best results
